# bitmesradotdev 

One platform for all developers at BIT Mesra. Students at BIT Mesra from various branches are coding day in day out. It's relatively easier for CSE/IT branch folks to get placed because of multiple reasons like Interactions with seniors, technical clubs, more time (yeah I feel sorry for coders who are maintaining absolute grading and their passion). 

This is just a small attempt to bring all devs@BIT regardless of their background, knowledge, language proficiency, on one platform and also give them a reputed platform to show off to their recruiters. 

## Installation
